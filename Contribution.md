**Adding Features and Fixing bugs**:
To add new features or fix bugs please create a branch off of the features branch. Once you have implmented your desired change please create a PR into the features branch, ensure that your PR description 
accurately describes the changes you have made and that you have made unit tests so we can verify your changes work. 

**Updating the keyword filter**: 
If you notice that some comments are not being caught by our current spam keyword dictionary you can help to improve it! Please make a branch off the keyword-updates branch and once you have added the new keywords 
to the keyword dictionary in content.js create a PR back to the keyword-updates branch.

Thanks for helping to improve Spamurai!
